    <h2>I love writing</h2>
    <p class="description">
      I always wanted to be a journalist: When I was 12 years old, I founded my
      own magazine and sold it to my neighbors. Today, I'm a freelance editor,
      texting for magazines and companies, still in love with creating worlds
      and emotions with letters.

    <h2>I love graphic design</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Creativity does not only hide in letters, but also in designs, patterns
      and layouts. That's why I always loved graphic design, tinkered around
      with photoshop and studied the art of graphic design with courses and
      creative sessions.

    <h2>I love coding</h2>
    <p class="description">
      That creative spark is also something that you need, when coding a website
      or application. My heart always beat for technical stuff, that's why I
      started learning how to code: to unite my creativity, nerdiness and tech
      passion.

    <h2>I love photography</h2>
    <p class="description">
      Photography is telling stories without words. That's why I'm always on the
      move ‚Äì armed with my Leica ‚Äì to keep a hold of that special moment, that
      is only inherent in the here and now, and will be gone in a blink of an
      eye.

      <h2>Follow me on Social Media</h2>
      <p class="description">
        Yes, I'm one of these Millennials who love Social Media. But instead of
        posting two selfies a day, I'm mostly on the lookout for the next
        creative hit.
      </p>
      <i class="fab fa-instagram-square"></i>
      <h4>Instagram</h4>
      <p>Follow me on Insta, watch my world of photography unfold. Do it!</p>
      <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>
      <h4>LinkedIn</h4>
      <p>
        Let's connect on LinkedIn to network and stay in touch. What do you
        think?
      </p>
      <i class="fab fa-twitter-square"></i>
      <h4>Twitter</h4>
      <p>
        I rarely use twitter to post stuff, but it's the perfect inspiration,
        isn't it?
